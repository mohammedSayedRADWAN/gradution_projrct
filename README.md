# Udacity: Build A Storefront Backend

This is a backend API build in Nodejs for an online store. It exposes a RESTful API that will be used by the frontend developer on the frontend. 

The database schema and and API route information can be found in the [REQUIREMENT.md](REQUIREMENTS.md)

## Set up Database
### Create Databases
We shall create the dev and test database.

- connect to the default postgres database as the server's root user `psql -U postgres`

- In psql run the following to create the dev and test database
    - `CREATE DATABASE store;`
    - `CREATE DATABASE store_test;`
- Connect to the databases 
    - Grant for dev database
        - `\c store`
        
    - Grant for test database
        - `\c store_test`
        

### Migrate Database
 run the command in terminal to migrate the database 
 `npx db-migrate create mythical-worlds-table --sql-file`
# for create tables
`npx db-migrate up`

# for drop tables
`npx db-migrate reset`

## Enviromental Variables Set up
Bellow are the environmental variables that needs to be set in a `.env` file. This is the default setting that I used for development, but you can change it to what works for you. 

**NB:** The given values are used in developement and testing but not in production. 
```
PORT=3000
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=store
POSTGRES_DB_test=store_test
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=1662001
ENV=test
BCRYPT_PASSWWORD=speak-friend-and-enter
SALT_ROUNDS=10
TOKEN_SECRET=yourToken
```

## Start App
`npm run start`

-note:you must run `npx db-migrate up` to ensure tables created

### Running Ports 
After start up, the server will start on port `3000` and the database on port `5432`

## Endpoint Access
All endpoints are described in the [REQUIREMENT.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) file. 

## Token and Authentication
Tokens are passed along with the http header as 
```
Authorization   Bearer <token>
```

## Testing
Run test with 

`npm run test`

It sets the environment to `test`, migrates up tables for the test database, run the test then migrate down all the tables for the test database. 

## Important Notes 

### Environment Variables
Environment variables are set in the `.env` file and added in `.gitignore` so that it won't be added to github. However, I had provided the names of the variables that need to be set above. I also provided the values that were used in development and testing. 

### Changing Enviroment to testing 
I had set up two databases, one for development and the other for testing. During testing, I had to make sure the testing database is used instead of the developement database. 

To acheive this, I set up a variable in the `.env` file which is by default set to `dev`. During testing, the command `npm run test` will set this variable to `testing` in the package.json. Here is the complete command.
`set ENV=test && tsc && db-migrate --env test down -c 3&&db-migrate --env test up && tsc  && jasmine`

The first command migrates all tables then the second command changes the enviroment variable `ENVI` to testing, then the jasmine is run and then after testing, the database is reset.
